Hyperskill Fright Night Coding Challenge Day 1

It was a perfectly miserable autumn day: rain, gray skies, and 
... blah blah blah ...
At last, a gate appeared. Behind it, a mansion hunched in the dark, ... blah blah blah.

### The only problem is the gate. How do you open it? There is a panel with 10 digits and a brief instruction:

- The code to the gates is four digits. It is the first, the second, the third and the fourth most common digit in today's sequence, in that particular order. If there are equal number of appearances, higher digit should come first.

- The [sequence](hyperskill-dataset.txt) looks enormous, you could spend hours calculating the code by hand. Good thing you brought your laptop, right? A small program that calculates the answer should not be too hard...
