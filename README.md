Hyperskill Fright Night Coding Challenge Day 1

### blah blah blah ...
So you walked. Mud, fog, regret. At last, a gate appeared. Behind it, a mansion hunched in the dark, like an artefact of an era long gone, its windows faintly glowing. Maybe you could ask for a phone call, tell your uncle what happened, surely he could pick you up.

### The only problem is the gate. How do you open it? There is a panel with 10 digits and a brief instruction:

- The code to the gates is four digits. It is the first, the second, the third and the fourth most common digit in today's sequence, in that particular order. If there are equal number of appearances, higher digit should come first.

- The sequence looks enormous, you could spend hours calculating the code by hand. Good thing you brought your laptop, right? A small program that calculates the answer should not be too hard...
